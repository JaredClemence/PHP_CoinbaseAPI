This code is a tested API interface for Coinbase's Exchange server coded in PHP.

The code is available for use by any person finding this page. It is offered without warranty or guarantee.

## Quick Start

To use the code, do the following:

1. Clone this repository into your current project.

2. Edit the settings.ini file to include you 'live' and 'sandbox' keys as well as your bot_name. (Note, the settings.ini file initializes your project into 'sandbox' mode.  Change the mode to 'live' when you are ready to run against the live exchange.

3. Review function comments to determine what is returned by each method.  Each method provides a service corresponding to an API REST call that is listed on the api documentation at https://docs.exchange.coinbase.com/
